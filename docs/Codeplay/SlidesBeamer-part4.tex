\begin{frame}{When something goes wrong}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Find which pass introduces the issue:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{llc -print-after-all}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Dump the detailed output for the pass:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{llc foo.ll -debug-only codegen-dce 2>\&1 > foo.log}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Check the pass's LLVM source file for the debug type:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{\#define DEBUG\_TYPE "codegen-dce"}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Compare the \texttt{-print-after-all} or \texttt{-debug-only} outputs with and without the 'problem' change
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Debugging LLVM}

\begin{itemize}
    \item MIs, BBs, functions, almost anything → call \texttt{X.dump()}
    \item DAGs, CFGs → call \texttt{X.viewGraph()} (pops up xdot)
    \item Or from the terminal: \texttt{llc foo.ll -view-isel-dags}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Try -view-dag1-combine-dags, -view-legalize-dags, -view-sched-dags, etc.
    \end{itemize}
    \item To view graphs, make sure you build LLVM in debug mode!
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Turn on \texttt{LLVM\_ENABLE\_ASSERTIONS} (i.e. \texttt{NDEBUG} should not be defined)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{"Cannot select"}

\begin{itemize}
    \item LLVM doesn't know how to map ('lower') a DAG node to an actual instruction
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Missing pattern in \texttt{LEGInstrInfo.td}?
    \end{itemize}
    \item Check the graph - verify that the following match up:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Number of operands
        \item Order of operands
        \item Types of operands
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{The dog ate my homework}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Why did my code disappear?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Dead Code Elimination may have removed it
        \item Missing chain or glue constraints in the DAG
    \end{itemize}
    \item DCE does not touch instructions whose value is used by other instructions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Root your use/def chains using a MI that has side-effects
    \end{itemize}
    \item DCE does not touch instructions with side-effects:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item TableGen attributes: \texttt{mayLoad}, \texttt{mayStore}, \texttt{hasSideEffects}...
    \end{itemize}
